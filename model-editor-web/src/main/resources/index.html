// WELCOME STRANGER!

// This is a short intro to BioDivine model format.

// As you can see, the format supports C-style line comments starting with //.
# You can also use python-like line comments starting with #.

/*
    Finally, block comments are also supported, even with proper nesting:
    /* This is a nested comment. */ But this is still a comment!
*/

// The model itself is described using a set of declarations (the order of declarations does not matter), each separated by a new line.

// ========== CONSTANTS AND LITERALS ==========

// The simplest type of declaration is a constant:

const temperature = 300

// You can use all common formats for numbers, including scientific notation:
const kelvin_to_celsius = -273.15
const avogadro = 6.023e23

// Aside from numbers, you can use booleans:
const Yes = true

// Single line strings (including escaping):
const hello = "hello"
const two_line_string = "hello \n world"

// Arrays of arbitrary expressions:
const some_values = [false, -5.6, ["nested", "array"], "cat", 5 + 6]
// (You will learn more about expressions in the upcoming section about functions.)

// And finally, intervals:
const zero_to_pie = [0 .. 3.14]

// Since constants are often easier to describe the way they are actually derived, you can use an
// arbitrary expression in the declaration of a constant too:
const temperature_celsius = temperature + kelvin_to_celsius

// ========== NOTES ABOUT SAFETY ==========

// The model format does not assume any semantic meaning to its operators. Hence it cannot enforce any form of type safety!
// Subsequently, the following statement is completely fine from the formatting standpoint:
const what = (TT - hello) * avogadro + [1, 5]

/*
    It is up to the actual tool to interpret the model and decide what (true - "hello") means.
    This is an important aspect of the format, as it allows to quickly prototype new ideas without heavily modifying the parser.
    Suppose you wanted to implement a tool which works with numeric intervals instead of exact numbers. In such case [1..2] + [-3..4]
    might be a perfectly ok statement.

    !!TODO!! However, in order to quickly verify models, you can load different validators into the editor based on the tool you are targeting.
    The validator then takes the parsed model file and outputs errors based on the actual constraints of the targeted tool.
    You can even select multiple validators at once - this can result in duplicate errors (each validator works independently), but can be very
    useful when writing models for different tools.

    !!TODO!! For example, if you now enable the .bio validator, the 'what' constant becomes invalid since .bio only supports numeric constants.

    If you don't know which tool you are targeting or simply writing a general model, the editor defaults to a basic "common" validator.
    This validator provides basic sanity checks, such as unknown identifiers, invalid usage of functions/constants
    (constants used as functions, function with incorrect arguments...), double declarations, etc.

    You can always turn it off and continue without any validation in case you need maximal flexibility. However, models which break
    the common validator are typically not supported by other general model analysis tools provided by BioDivine (dependency inspector,
    latex output).
*/

// ========== FUNCTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS ==========

// In order to structure your model and avoid duplication, you can define custom functions that can be used in other declarations:

fun hill(x, k) = x / (x + k)
const k1 = 1.28 * hill(4.3, 2)

/*
    The key element when defining functions are expressions. The model language currently supports the following operators (ordered by priority):
        - logical or: a || b
        - logical and: a && b
        - comparisons: a > b, a < b, a <= b, a >= b, a == b, a != b
        - binary minus: a - b
        - binary plus: a + b
        - binary division: a / b
        - binary multiplication: a * b
        - unary not: !a
        - unary plus: +
        - unary minus: -a

    If you are not sure about operator priority, you can always enforce the correct priority using parentheses.
*/

// Notice that due to the expressiveness of the format, you can even write many "high-level" expressions such as:
fun between_three_and_six(a) = 3 < a < 6 // This can be interpreted as 3 < a  && a < 6
fun isMore(x) = (x >= 3) > (x >= 4) // Can be interpreted as x >= 3 contains more elements than x >= 4
// (of course, these are simply suggestions and it is up to the actual tool whether it supports such syntax)

/*
    These operators are great for defining continuous/boolean functions, but struggle when defining more complex
    discrete functions. To make this easier, we introduce a when operator, which allows to give multiple case
    expressions, each based on a guard expression:

    when {
        guard expression -> case expression
        ...
    }

    (here, the whitespace can be arbitrary, but each guard-case pair has to be separated by a new line)
*/

fun normalize(a) = when {
    a < 3 -> 3
    a > 6 -> 6
    true -> a
}

/*
    Note that the semantics of the when operator are also loose/undefined. So the guard expressions do not have to
    be exclusive, or return a boolean at all!

    This is useful if you want to implement non-determinism: you can take all applicable cases, or just the first one, and so on.
*/


// ========== PARAMETERS AND ENUMS ==========

// Most models contain parameters. In a sense, parameters are simply glorified constants, because they are constant, but their
// value is unknown. Overall, parameters are also defined similar to constants, however, instead of providing an exact value,
// you specify a set of possible values. This can be again done using an arbitrary expression (its interpretation again rests
// on the tool used, but in general at least interval bounds and value enumeration should be supported):

param p in [0..1]
param isActive in [true, false]

// For more advanced tools, one can always use more complex expressions, for example to express dependence between parameters:

param p1 in [0.1..1.4] && (-1.2 < p1 + p2 < 4.4)
param p2 in [-4.1..5.6] && (-1.2 < p1 + p2 < 4.4)

// This still leaves discrete values. Here, enumerations are a good start, but sometimes,
// we would like something more customisable. To this end, we allow the definition of enums:

enum Status { OK, NOK, UNKNOWN }
param masterStatus in Status

// This turns 'masterStatus' into an enum of type Status with three named values. You can access these values
// using the standard dot syntax in any expression:

fun isMasterOk() = masterStatus == Status.OK
fun invertStatus(status) = when {
    status == Status.OK -> Status.NOK
    status == Status.NOK -> Status.OK
    true -> status
}

// ========== VARIABLES ==========

// Finally, the most fundamental part of a model: variables. Variables are values which change over time (interestingly time itself is
// a variable too). However, the manner in which the variables change is the most interesting aspect.

// In this regard, BioDivine modelling language considers two types of variables: Continuous (or flow) variables and discrete variables.
// Continuous variables are subject to a flow function which defines how they change over time. This function does not have to be
// continuous (in fact, thanks to loose typing, it does not even have to be numeric, it just have to signify the "change" to the tool employed).
// Discrete variables on the other hand do not change spontaneously, but as a result of events. An event is an instant discrete action
// which can arbitrarily update the values of any variable (even flow variable).

// In on itself, the definition of a discrete variable isn't very different from a definition of a parameter. As with the parameter,
// the state space of a variable is defined using an arbitrary expression:

var x in [1..10]
var status in Status

// Things get a little more complex for flow variables, as here, we have two expressions. The bounds expression and flow expression:

var y in ([-1..1] && y < x) = 0.2 * x - y

// Finally, let's say we want to update the x variable whenever y hits it's highest possible value. To this end, we would use an event.
// An event consits of a guard expression (in general, these are the conditions under which the event can fire) and a block
// of variable updates:

event (y = 1) {
    x = 1
    status = Status.OK
}

event (y < 0) {
    x = 10
    status = Status.NOK
}

// Note that the top level parenthesis around the guard condition are mandatory, but can be ommitted if there is no condition.
// Also note that it is again up to the tool how it interprets the guards, event priority, fairness, immediateness, delay, etc.
// of each event.

// ========== EXTERNAL DEFINITIONS ==========

// Sometimes, we need to use some "standard" function or constant which the targeted tool provides, but cannot be defined directly in
// the modelling language. To this end, the format allows external declarations. The declaration provides just enough
// information to allow basic integrity checks, but is left to the target tool to implement.
// Currently, only external functions and constants are supported in the standard file format. In the future, this might be extended
// to other types of declarations (which are currently available in the unverified mode).

// In general, external declarations are defined the same way as classic declarations, without the actual definition:

external const PI
external fun pow(base, exponent)

// ========== ANNOTATIONS ==========

// While the language is heavily extensible, in some cases, what you really need is to append additional data to the model without
// modifying its semantics. To this end, annotations are provided. Annotation is simply a named "data bundle" attached to the
// declaration. The data bundle consists of a list of (optionally) named arguments. This data can be then used in other pre- and
// post-processing tools.

// One nice use case is providing "renderable" names, so that the model can be automatically translated for example to LaTeX,
// which greatly simplifies its inclusion into papers, websites or presentations.

@LaTeX("k_1")
const k1 = -2.1

// Another possible use case is providing recommended options for other tools. In this case, the continuous variable 'z' has to be
// approximated by ramp functions and the annotations give the arguments for the approximation procedure:

@Thresholds(0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 0.8)
@Ramp(samplePoints = 10000, ramps = 20)
var z in [0..1] = k1 * z - pow(z, -z)

// Of course, the semantics and expected format of each annotation is again tool specific. However, the presence and form of annotations
// can be also checked by a custom validator.
