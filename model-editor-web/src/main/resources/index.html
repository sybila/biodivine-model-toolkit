// WELCOME STRANGER!

// This is a short intro to BioDivine model format.

// As you can see, the format supports C-style line comments starting with //.
# You can also use python-like line comments starting with #.

/*
Finally, block comments are also supported, even with proper nesting:
/* This is a nested comment. */ But this is still a comment!
*/

// The model itself is described using a set of declarations (the order of declarations does not matter), each separated by a new line.

// ========== CONSTANTS AND LITERALS ==========

// The simplest type of declaration is a constant:

const temperature = 300

// You can use all common formats for numbers, including scientific notation:
const kelvin_to_celsius = -273.15
const avogandro = 6.023e23

// Aside from numbers, you can use booleans:
const Yes = true

// Single line strings (including escaping):
const hello = "hello"
const two_line_string = "hello \n world"

// Arrays of arbitrary expressions:
const some_values = [false, -5.6, ["nested", "array"], "cat", 5 + 6]
// (You will learn more about expressions in the upcoming section about functions.)

// And finally, intervals:
const zero_to_pie = [0 .. 3.14]

// Since constants are often easier to describe the way they are actually derived, you can use an
// arbitrary expression in the declaration of a constant too:
const temperature_celsius = temperature + kelvin_to_celsius

// ========== NOTES ABOUT SAFETY ==========

// The model format does not assume any semantic meaning to its operators. Hence it cannot enforce any form of type safety!
// Subsequently, the following statement is completely fine from the formatting standpoint:
const what = (TT - hello) * avogandro + [1, 5]

/*
It is up to the actual tool to interpret the model and decide what (true - "hello") means.
This is an important aspect of the format, as it allows to quickly prototype new ideas without heavily modifying the parser.
Suppose you wanted to implement a tool which works with numeric intervals instead of exact numbers. In such case [1,2] + [-3,4]
might be a perfectly ok statement.

!!TODO!! However, in order to quickly verify models, you can load different validators into the editor based on the tool you are targeting.
The validator then takes the parsed model file and outputs errors based on the actual constraints of the targeted tool.
You can even select multiple validators at once - this can result in duplicate errors (each validator works independently), but can be very
useful when writing models for different tools.

!!TODO!! For example, if you now enable the .bio validator, the 'what' constant becomes invalid since .bio only supports numeric constants.

If you don't know which tool you are targeting or simply writing a general model, the editor defaults to a basic "common" validator.
This validator provides basic sanity checks, such as unknown identifiers, invalid usage of functions/constants
(constants used as functions, function with incorrect arguments...), double declarations, etc.

You can always turn it off and continue without any validation in case you need maximal flexibility. However, models which break
the common validator are typically not supported by other general model analysis tools provided by BioDivine (dependency inspector,
latex output).
*/

// ========== FUNCTIONS AND EXPRESSIONS ==========

// In order to structure your model and avoid duplication, you can define custom functions that can be used in other declarations:

fun hill(x, k) = x / (x + k)
const k1 = 1.28 * hill(4.3, 2)

/*
The key element when defining functions are expressions. The model language currently supports the following operators (ordered by priority):
- logical or: a || b
- logical and: a && b
- comparisons: a > b, a < b, a <= b, a >= b, a == b, a != b
- binary minus: a - b
- binary plus: a + b
- binary division: a / b
- binary multiplication: a * b
- unary not: !a
- unary plus: +
- unary minus: -a

If you are not sure about operator priority, you can always enforce the correct priority using parentheses.
*/

// Notice that due to the expressiveness of the format, you can even write many "high-level" expressions such as:
fun between_three_and_six(a) = 3 < a < 6 // This can be interpreted as 3 < a  && a < 6
fun isMore(x) = (x >= 3) > (x >= 4) // Can be interpreted as x >= 3 contains more elements than x >= 4
// (of course, these are simply suggestions and it is up to the actual tool whether it supports such syntax)

/*
These operators are great for defining continuous/boolean functions, but struggle when defining more complex
discrete functions. To make this easier, we introduce a when operator, which allows to give multiple case
expressions, each based on a guard expression:

when {
guard expression -> case expression
...
}

(here, the whitespace can be arbitrary, but each guard-case pair has to be separated by a new line)
*/

fun normalize(a) = when {
a < 3 -> 3
a > 6 -> 6
true -> a
}

/*
Note that the semantics of the when operator are also loose/undefined. So the guard expressions do not have to
be exclusibe, or return a boolean at all!

This is useful if you want to implement non-determinism: you can take all applicalbe cases, or just the first one, and so on.
